The bar chart offers a simplified view of the top OTUs, while the bubble chart provides a more comprehensive representation of the entire sample. By selecting different test subject IDs, users can compare and contrast the microbial composition of various individuals, making it a useful tool for exploring and analyzing belly button biodiversity data.
